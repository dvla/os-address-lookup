DVLA Ordnance Survey Service
============================

`ordnance-survey` is a [microservice][microservices] fa√ßade for the [Ordnance Survey API][ordnance-survey], encapsulating organisation-wide configuration such as authentication and licensing.

The codebase is predominantly [Scala][scala] and is implemented against [Spray][spray]: a lightweight HTTP framework for the JVM.

The application is calling the ordnancesurvey.co.uk service to retrieve addresses from a postcode. 

Running the application
-----------------------

	The application is running as part of an exemplar by executing the following command on the exemplar:

    	sbt sandbox

    To run this microservice on its own, you have to create a fat jar and then run this jar. To do so:

    	sbt assembly
    	java -jar target/scala-2.11/os-address-lookup-XXX.jar

    	where XXX is the current version

    The listening port is defined in src/main/resources/application.conf, under the `port` property
